Nevertheless, various bodies of literature have made important strides in understanding specific elements of personal growth, such as the mindsets that foster such growth (e.g., growth mindset), growth following extreme challenges (e.g., post-traumatic growth), and personal growth within specific roles (e.g., leadership development). While these and other literature streams offer valuable insights about growth, they lack integration, resulting in an incomplete understanding of how employees achieve personal growth at work. To further research on personal growth in organizations, we review 292 articles from six streams of organizational and psychology literature that explore various aspects of personal growth. We provide an integration of the existing literature by developing a clear definition of personal growth, offering an integrative process model of personal growth, identifying opportunities for cross-pollination across growth literatures, and providing a clear agenda for future research on this topic. Our integrative framework responds to the expanding scholarly interest in personal growth and the increasing emphasis that individuals place on it as a crucial element of their working lives.", "authors": "Manjari Ganti, Susan J.

However, conceptualization (and operationalization) of this construct is inconsistent, and sometimes conflates with that of other constructs, thereby weakening our understanding of cognitive flexibility and muddling the theories that rest on it. To bring clarity, we conduct a comprehensive search of cognitive flexibility constructs, strip away their labels, and use text analysis and manual coding of their descriptions to distinguish among five fluid thought processes: (1) elaborating, (2) dimensionalizing, (3) integrating, (4) juxtaposing, and (5) matching. We further group these processes into three higher-order categories involving the reshaping, contending, and shifting of cognitive structures\u2014and conduct a literature review of their consequences and antecedents. Our surveying demonstrates that these processes\u2019 substance and implications differ markedly. As such, we argue that cognitive flexibility may be more appropriately viewed as a multifaceted, rather than monolithic, construct.

Although much existing work has focused on freeze frames of specific aspects of anger, integrating these dimensions spurred development of the intensity-direction framework, which encapsulates two unifying underlying themes: the intensity (which can be amplified or dampened) and direction (which can be focused or redirected) of anger.

Though systematic categorizing was once proposed as a remedy for those concerns, as it had resolved similar ones in other scientific disciplines, conversation about that potential ceased decades ago. This integrative review revives and refocuses that conversation by systematically categorizing how management scholars categorize concepts and phenomena, in four phases. Phases 1 and 2 (conceptual-mapping and etymological reviews, respectively) together yield a framework encompassing three general approaches\u2014classical, commonsense, and contemporary\u2014scholars across all scientific disciplines, including management studies, historically have taken to categorize concepts and phenomena. Phase 3 (a qualitative review) determines that management scholars seldom use formal methods to categorize. Finally, Phase 4 (another qualitative review) yields a second framework that more meaningfully differentiates the ways management scholars currently categorize. The results indicate that categorizing in management studies remains unsystematic due to scholars predominantly relying on intuitive methods and introducing idiosyncratic categorial schemes instead of rigorous methods to improve extant ones.

In addition, we theorize the necessary conditions for successful performance of the institutional game. We explain that when background \u201ctheatres of meaning\u201d are not in place, the subtleties of this most delicate type of institutional work will be lost, and institutional accidents will likely emerge. Accordingly, our perspective contributes beyond the revisiting of fundamental assumptions of decoupling theory.

We identify six areas for further investigation that can meaningfully inform policies: the intentional dark side of institutional entrepreneurs, the unintended actions of regulators, the role of investigative journalists, the impact of institutional conditions, various forms of interrelated multilevel decoupling, and multiple moral ethos. We also propose several policy implications. First, simplifying regulation and decreasing the number of regulatory agencies can reduce institutional uncertainties and mitigate chances for opportunistic behavior. Second, through extensive consultations with stakeholders and limiting opportunities for preferential access, policymakers can minimize the risk of regulatory capture.

First, we reimagine the role of MNEs as \u201cchief orchestrators\u201d in GVCs, driving digital sustainability through orchestration activities underpinning coordination and collaboration, which in turn generates opportunities for value capture and creation along the GVC. Second, we disentangle the impact of MNE-driven digital sustainability, unpacking the undesired consequences for GVC partners relating to dependency, power dynamics, transparency, and supplier squeeze or exclusion. Our insights temper claims about the transformative potential of digital sustainability, challenging scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to reflect on and respond to the double-edged effects of MNE-driven digital sustainability in GVCs. Our arguments are demonstrated through three illustrative cases from firms across industries (agriculture, energy, and fast-moving consumer goods). We identify implications for management practice and policy and offer guideposts for future research. ", "authors": "Claire Kilpatrick, Kieran M.

Our study bridges this gap by employing the concept of multiple embeddedness and conducting case studies with student startups at a German public university to scrutinize how they succeeded or failed in leveraging resources available in both the university and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems. The findings reveal that the university entrepreneurial ecosystem may unintentionally foster students\u2019 dependence on university support, impeding student entrepreneurs from developing their embeddedness in the regional ecosystem. We theorize this as a \u201cnesting effect\u201d by identifying mechanisms through which students struggle to leverage resources from both the university and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems due to relational over-embeddedness.

Addressing it requires the global economy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. \u201cNet zero\u201d describes a state in which, globally, the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere is balanced by the amount of emissions removed. As some sectors and firms are more difficult to decarbonize, net-zero pathways indicate that others must move beyond net zero and adopt a regenerative approach. Although carbon emissions are inherently physical, digital innovation might be the key to accelerating progress on net zero, given its potential to measure, coordinate, and change the emissions logic of the current economy. This paper aims to construct a novel perspective on digital sustainability by exploring how digitally enabled and digital-first innovation can contribute to net zero. We develop a framework of four complementary digital net-zero strategies by synthesizing insights from prior literature with empirical illustrations. The framework serves as a starting point for future research and provides practical guidance for net-zero strategizing. It challenges digital sustainability research and practice to complement emissions reduction efforts with removal and regeneration and to explore both digitally enabled and digital-first innovation for net zero.

Defensive organizing consolidates, we argue, when it can shield leaders and members of an organization from anxiety while letting them perform their roles.

A key insight of our study is that imagining unfolds in two ways: (1) bright imagining is associated with disconnecting moral issues from idea development, so that creators develop ideas in the relative absence of constraints and moral issues are addressed through systematized safeguards; (2) dark imagining is associated with integrating moral issues into idea development, transforming morally motivated constraints into creative forces with potential to shape the nature of ideas themselves.

However, this rests on a strong assumption of information efficiency that market actors correctly assess how specific an individual\u2019s skills are, and price it appropriately. Emerging theoretical viewpoints dispute this, pointing out labor market imperfections and substantial difficulty in observing FSHC. We therefore develop theory about how perceived FSHC may relate positively to mobility by articulating a role for well-known supply-side mechanisms such as job satisfaction, embeddedness, and preference for job autonomy. Using two archival surveys and two primary surveys collected in very different contexts (South Korea and the United States), we found support for our theory. Perceptions of FSHC were associated with increased mobility and this effect was partially mediated by job satisfaction and job embeddedness. The effect was augmented for workers who value autonomy in their jobs (and who are more likely to exit if they perceived their skills as FSHC). Since the effect of perceived FSHC is quite different from that of extant theory which focused on actual FSHC, we explore implications for resource-based and human capital theories.", "authors": "Bukky Akinsanmi Oyedeji, Russell W.

We articulate three heretofore overlooked properties of algorithmic performance management systems that differentiate them from other human\u2013algorithm augmentations, including the goal of aligning third-party (i.e., employee) behavior, the tension between algorithmic accuracy and alternative logics for managing performance, and limitations of user expertise or access leading to corrective actions outside of (rather than within) the algorithm.

Strangers, who lack previous interactions and trust, cannot rely on human reciprocity as they engage in social and economic exchange. They have a tendency to defect for maximizing individual interests rather than to cooperate for benefiting each party in the exchange. Blockchain-based smart contracts come with the promise of solving this dilemma of cooperation. In this paper, we trace this promise to a new mechanism of cooperation, programmed reciprocity, defined as coded instructions for automatically returning good for good (positive reciprocity) and ill for ill (negative reciprocity). Programmed reciprocity is rooted in the algorithmic enforcement capability of blockchain networks, defined as the ability to guarantee the execution of the rules of an exchange agreement without a central authority and the possibility of human interference by either of the involved parties. We propose that algorithmic enforcement capability positively affects the viability of cooperation among strangers on the blockchain through programmed reciprocity. This is contingent on the level of contract complexity and blockchain confidence.

Our theorizing highlights that differences in individual characteristics contribute to diversity in directors\u2019 emotional reactions. Next, we consider how directors\u2019 emotions subsequently evolve as board members interact. We develop a novel typology of affective states that characterize the emotional environment in the boardroom and help predict the emotional costs (i.e., psychological strain) incurred by directors as a result. Finally, we show how emotional costs have long-term implications for board functioning, thereby highlighting legacies of activism that have yet to be explored in prior work. In theorizing about how emotion influences activist episodes, we also develop a valuable lens with broad applicability for scholarship in the behavioral governance domain.", "authors": "Jeremy J.

We reinterpret the process of quantitative management research through Richard Rorty\u2019s pragmatism and specify how reflexivity may arise in its different phases. Reflexive quantitative research is conscious of the possibility of multiple purposes for scholarship and, consequently, calls for a pluralistic and contingent view of epistemology and methodological standards.

We theorize how different levels of perceived agency of AI affect human trust in AI. We do so by investigating three causal pathways. First, an AI (and its designer) perceived as more agentic will be seen as more capable, and therefore will be perceived as more trustworthy. Second, the more the AI is perceived as agentic, the more important are trustworthiness perceptions about the AI relative to those about its designer. Third, because of betrayal aversion, the anticipated psychological cost of the AI violating trust increases with how agentic it is perceived to be. These causal pathways imply, perhaps counterintuitively, that making an AI appear more agentic may increase or decrease the trust that humans place in it: success at meeting the Turing test may go hand in hand with a decrease of trust in AI. We formulate propositions linking agency perceptions to trust in AI, by exploiting variations in the context in which the human\u2013AI interaction occurs and the dynamics of trust updating.", "authors": "Bart S.

Board decision synergy occurs when the board decision-making process reduces the overall influence of cognitive, personal, and group biases on a given decision. We develop a configurational model in which board decision synergy occurs if, and only if, all of the following information-processing outcomes are present: information heterogeneity, information elaboration, and choice consensus. Each information-processing outcome occurs in a specific decision-making phase, and only as the consequence of specific configurations of board cognitive diversity and director empowerment.

We argue that while the displacement of temporal disruptions (i.e., the dissimilarity in temporal demands pre- and post-disruption) has a negative effect on individual functioning, their duration (i.e., the length of occurrence of the disruption) has a reverse J-shaped one. Then, using displacement and duration, we develop a typology of disruptions as time wrinkling, ripping, reshaping, and razing. Next, we propose that individuals can react to those temporal disruptions via three temporal resilience responses: adjusting, absorbing, or adopting. These three responses differentially and respectively allow the individual to return to either objective, subjective, or both forms of temporal fit. Further, depending on the type of disruption, each temporal resilience response sets the individual onto particular trajectories toward the previous temporal equilibrium or to a new, more optimal one.", "authors": "Liliana P\u00e9rez-Nordtvedt, David A.

Although prior studies of constituency-building have highlighted how enlisting stakeholders in political battles creates unique opportunities and risks, what has been overlooked is the importance of firms assembling \u201cstrange bedfellows\u201d of economically and morally motivated constituents, sometimes called \u201cbootlegger-and-Baptist\u201d coalitions. Drawing on theories developed in research on regulatory economics, political processes, social movements, and corporate political strategy, we advance a theoretical framework to examine the trade-offs of firms creating blended coalitions consisting of parties who each have distinct economic and moral motives as opposed to uniform coalitions. We argue that blended coalitions often generate greater benefits by increasing policymakers\u2019 support. However, we highlight higher costs at each of four key stages in blending coalitions\u2014searching for partners, coordinating with partners, mobilizing partners, and monitoring partners\u2014and discuss mitigation strategies. We further develop theory on how to implement blended coalitions, including formulating messages for constituents and choosing policymakers to target. We develop propositions to advance theory development on constituency-building, linked to stakeholder mobilization and social movement approaches. We offer wide-ranging real-world examples to provide guidance for empirical research.", "authors": "Maurice J.

We redress this imbalance by advancing a conceptual framework of principal costs vis-\u00e0-vis the firm. We first show how principal costs can exist even in the single-principal corporate context, based on owner consumption and competence characteristics, which allows us to also distinguish principal costs from both agency costs and principal\u2013principal expropriation costs. We then extend our principal costs theory to the multi-principal context, in which we highlight how principal costs, including private benefits of influence, can exist even in corporations with no controlling shareholder enjoying private benefits of control. In this latter context, we redirect the agency theoretic lens of incentive and informational concerns toward active minority shareholders whose actions generate principal costs vis-\u00e0-vis the firm, as well as passive shareholders who fail to constrain such principal costs. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of our theory for current and future corporate governance research, practice, and public policy.", "authors": "Edward J.

Strangers, who lack previous interactions and trust, cannot rely on human reciprocity as they engage in social and economic exchange. They have a tendency to defect for maximizing individual interests rather than to cooperate for benefiting each party in the exchange. Blockchain-based smart contracts come with the promise of solving this dilemma of cooperation. In this paper, we trace this promise to a new mechanism of cooperation, programmed reciprocity, defined as coded instructions for automatically returning good for good (positive reciprocity) and ill for ill (negative reciprocity). Programmed reciprocity is rooted in the algorithmic enforcement capability of blockchain networks, defined as the ability to guarantee the execution of the rules of an exchange agreement without a central authority and the possibility of human interference by either of the involved parties. We propose that algorithmic enforcement capability positively affects the viability of cooperation among strangers on the blockchain through programmed reciprocity. This is contingent on the level of contract complexity and blockchain confidence. Our proposed framework extends the nascent literature on blockchain governance with a novel explanation of how programmed reciprocity can enhance cooperation among strangers. In doing this, it also addresses a significant yet unresolved problem in the literature on cooperation in social and economic exchanges.", "authors": "Robert Wayne Gregory, Roman Beck, Ola Henfridsson, Niam Yaraghi", "published": "2 July 2024"}, {"title": "Legacies of Shareholder Activism: The Dynamics\u00a0& Consequences of Emotion in the Boardroom", "link": "https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2020.0448", "abstract": "Despite indications that shareholder activism can elicit strong emotions, there is little theory that considers the effect of those emotions on board dynamics or the outcomes of activist episodes. This paper uses a \u201cphenomenon-driven\u201d approach to develop theory regarding how activism arouses director emotion, and what implications emotion has for boards during and after activist episodes. We leverage work on self-determination theory to explore conditions under which activism will arouse negative director emotion. Our theorizing highlights that differences in individual characteristics contribute to diversity in directors\u2019 emotional reactions. Next, we consider how directors\u2019 emotions subsequently evolve as board members interact. We develop a novel typology of affective states that characterize the emotional environment in the boardroom and help predict the emotional costs (i.e., psychological strain) incurred by directors as a result. Finally, we show how emotional costs have long-term implications for board functioning, thereby highlighting legacies of activism that have yet to be explored in prior work. In theorizing about how emotion influences activist episodes, we also develop a valuable lens with broad applicability for scholarship in the behavioral governance domain.", "authors": "Jeremy J.

This reputation has recently been called into question. Scholars increasingly doubt knowledge claims based on quantitative research and are concerned about questionable research practices. The proposed solutions revolve around developing and enforcing methodological procedures aiming to reveal and limit the researcher\u2019s subjective choices in the research process. We offer an alternative means to address the issue: reflexivity. Reflexive quantitative research assumes that the researcher\u2019s active role throughout the research process should be taken as a methodological starting point rather than an obstacle to meaningful scholarly inquiry. We reinterpret the process of quantitative management research through Richard Rorty\u2019s pragmatism and specify how reflexivity may arise in its different phases. Reflexive quantitative research is conscious of the possibility of multiple purposes for scholarship and, consequently, calls for a pluralistic and contingent view of epistemology and methodological standards.

We theorize how different levels of perceived agency of AI affect human trust in AI. We do so by investigating three causal pathways. First, an AI (and its designer) perceived as more agentic will be seen as more capable, and therefore will be perceived as more trustworthy. Second, the more the AI is perceived as agentic, the more important are trustworthiness perceptions about the AI relative to those about its designer. Third, because of betrayal aversion, the anticipated psychological cost of the AI violating trust increases with how agentic it is perceived to be. These causal pathways imply, perhaps counterintuitively, that making an AI appear more agentic may increase or decrease the trust that humans place in it: success at meeting the Turing test may go hand in hand with a decrease of trust in AI. We formulate propositions linking agency perceptions to trust in AI, by exploiting variations in the context in which the human\u2013AI interaction occurs and the dynamics of trust updating.", "authors": "Bart S.

Depending on the functionaries\u2019 reactions, we show there are three potential outcomes: institutional drift, layering, or reform.

The second way, temporary novelty reduction (TNR), involves strategically decreasing novelty in the short term to overcome environmental or functional resistance to novelty, often leading to a more creative product in the long term. Together, these two categories of novelty reduction support a new theoretical perspective: novelty reduction can play a critical role in the creative process.

We conceptualize the board decision-making process as occurring in three phases\u2014discovery, deliberation, and decision\u2014and we introduce the concept of board decision synergy as a form of effectiveness applicable to this process. Board decision synergy occurs when the board decision-making process reduces the overall influence of cognitive, personal, and group biases on a given decision. We develop a configurational model in which board decision synergy occurs if, and only if, all of the following information-processing outcomes are present: information heterogeneity, information elaboration, and choice consensus. Each information-processing outcome occurs in a specific decision-making phase, and only as the consequence of specific configurations of board cognitive diversity and director empowerment. Though multiple configurations of board cognitive diversity and director empowerment can produce board decision synergy in our model, we find that no configuration is individually sufficient. These insights underscore the complexity of board decision-making as a phenomenon and the potential for theory explaining its effective practice.", "authors": "Ryan Krause, Michael C.

Differentiating four types of CEO humor\u2014(1) affiliative, (2) self-enhancing, (3) self-defeating, and (4) aggressive\u2014we propose that each type induces distinct states of mind in infomediaries as well as attributions about the CEO. As our key idea, we then propose that the ultimate impact of CEO humor results from a combination of these primary effects; their (in)congruence with infomediaries\u2019 schemas of the CEO\u2019s essential functions, tasks, and social position; and the unique sociocognitive nature and content of the focal social evaluation construct. We apply our framework to the three social evaluation constructs of (1) social approval, (2) organizational reputation, and (3) organizational legitimacy. Specifically, we propose that affiliative CEO humor and self-enhancing CEO humor generally strengthen approval, reputation, and legitimacy, whereas self-defeating CEO humor weakens all three, and aggressive CEO humor has mixed effects, as it weakens social approval and legitimacy but strengthens reputation.

During this journey, innovation narratives play a crucial role in coordinating innovation. Innovation narratives are linguistic representations that actors use to make sense of innovation activities, events and actions. In other words, they are stories that drive sensemaking, which is a critical element in avoiding conflicts in product innovation process and securing coordinated activities between diverse actors. However, as SBVs shift markets and undergo radical changes, they may have to update narratives to fit these changes. Yet, little is known about how innovation narratives and coordination evolve during this journey. To improve knowledge on this matter, I conducted a 24-month study of a science-based venture crossing over to a commercial market. I find that during this transition, innovation narratives shift from being shaped by progressive storytelling, where the benefits of becoming commercial and hiring nonacademics is highlighted, to being shaped by retrogressive storytelling, where incumbents and newcomers use their respective pasts to develop divergent narratives, and finally to appearing as disintegrated storytelling, where narratives compete and hinder coordination in innovation processes.

Recent applications and research suggest that AI can not only influence but also accelerate innovation in organizations. However, as the field is rapidly growing, a common understanding of the underlying theoretical capabilities has become increasingly vague and fraught with ambiguity. In view of the centrality of innovation capabilities in making innovation happen, we bring together these scattered perspectives in a systematic and multidisciplinary literature review. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the role of AI in influencing innovation capabilities and provide a taxonomy of AI applications based on empirical studies. Drawing on the technological\u2013organizational\u2013environmental (TOE) framework, our review condenses the research findings of 62 studies. The results of our study are twofold. First, we identify a dichotomous view of innovation capabilities triggered by AI adoption: enabling and enhancing. The enabling capabilities are those that research identifies as enablers of AI adoption, underscoring the competencies and routines needed to implement AI. The enhancing capabilities denote the role that AI adoption has in transforming or creating innovation capabilities in organizations. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications that reflects the practical adoption of AI in relation to three underlying reasons: replace, reinforce, and reveal. Our study makes three main contributions. First, we identify the innovation capabilities that are either required for or generated by AI adoption. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications.

While findings from previous studies suggest that these firms can get access to a large pool of suggestions for market applications through technology broadcasting, we lack empirical evidence on whether firms that use technology broadcasting will actually be able to process and explore these suggestions. The current study points to the distinct role of firms' domain-specific and general knowledge base in this respect. It proposes that technology broadcasting is positively related to the number of market applications a firm explores. Moreover, it hypothesizes that this relationship is weakened by the firm's domain-specific knowledge and strengthened by its general knowledge base. We use Poisson analyses on hand-collected survey and secondary data on a sample of 205 Flemish startups. We find that technology broadcasting is positively associated with the number of market applications a firm explores. Furthermore, this positive relationship is stronger with increasing general knowledge, but weaker with increasing domain-specific knowledge. These findings advance our understanding of the boundary conditions of technology broadcasting.

Our study investigates whether firms can benefit from interdisciplinary research and development (R&D) activities by also reflecting on the potential negative consequences of increasing complexity of outcome validation activities at later stages of innovation processes. We explore which resources and organizational capabilities may influence the efficacy of interdisciplinary R&D activities. We examine whether the available financial slack, collaborations with universities, and a high betweenness centrality in scientific networks may promote the flexibility, scope, and efficiency of knowledge integration, and thus moderate the direct and mediated relationships between the degree of interdisciplinarity (DoI) of a firm's R&D activities and innovation performance. To test our hypotheses, we performed an analysis of medical technology firms that are highly dependent on interdisciplinary R&D. We collected a panel dataset of R&D activities and successful market launches of new products from 79 large medical technology firms between 1997 and 2021. The measurement of a firm's DoI is based on a novel approach involving neural networks in a bibliographic data graph. Our results suggest that firms can improve their innovation performance if they conduct interdisciplinary R&D activities. However, higher levels of DoI also increase the complexity of the required outcome validation, which reduces a firm's innovation performance. We also found that high levels of financial slack help to overcome barriers of implementing interdisciplinary R&D activities.

This power shift has important behavioral and psychological consequences for customers and, hence, has attracted considerable interest from academics and practitioners alike. However, the literature is scattered, provides inconsistent findings, and lacks both a comprehensive conceptualization and empirical overview. Specifically, extant literature neglects the situational nature of customer empowerment, equalizing inherently different customer empowerment activities while failing to consider the divergent effects on participating versus observing customers (i.e., customers who do not participate in the new product development process themselves). This limits advancement of the field, and impedes integration with the related fields of innovation, marketing, and consumer research. To facilitate a better understanding of the psychological and behavioral consequences of customer empowerment, we systematically review literature in the field and develop a conceptual framework that integrates different customer empowerment situations and their respective psychological (e.g., firm perceptions and feelings of empowerment) and behavioral (e.g., product preferences and willingness-to-pay) consequences. Using this framework, we structure previous research, highlight similarities and differences across customer empowerment situations, and set the stage for future research. By taking a customer perspective, this research advances our understanding of why some customer empowerment strategies are more successful than others (and under which circumstances).

However, there is a limited understanding of how and under what conditions project leaders' perceptions of failure normalization\u2014the norms regarding failure in their work environment\u2014can enhance product innovativeness in the context of new product development (NPD). Drawing upon sensemaking and motivation theories, we propose a moderated mediation model to address this research gap. Data were collected from 181 high-tech ventures in China, with responses gathered at three different time points from matched respondents. Utilizing moderated path analysis and the Monte Carlo method, our findings reveal that failure normalization primarily fosters product innovativeness by facilitating learning from failure. Importantly, this positive effect is contingent upon the project leader's passion for inventing. A profound passion for inventing significantly enhances NPD leaders' motivation to learn from failures, thereby acting as a pivotal factor that determines whether failure normalization promotes or impedes product innovativeness. This research thus elucidates the previously inconclusive relationship between failure normalization and product innovativeness as presented in the literature. It underscores the dual importance of organizational culture (specifically, failure normalization) and individual motivation (specifically, the passion for inventing) in driving learning and innovation within the NPD process. The practical implications of these findings are significant for high-tech ventures seeking to enhance their NPD outcomes. Specifically, cultivating an organizational culture that perceives failure as an opportunity for learning, coupled with recognizing and fostering the passion for inventing among NPD project leaders, can boost NPD product innovativeness.", "authors": "Xiangming (Tommy) Tao, Deniz Ucbasaran", "published": "11 July 2024"}, {"title": "Translating agile management practices into a traditional industry context", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpim.12760", "abstract": "This study explores the translation of agile management practices (agile) into a traditional industry context.

This research makes two main contributions. First, this research introduces translation theory to the innovation management literature and details its applicability in explaining variations in outcomes of applying management practices in new organizational contexts. Our research suggests that this constitutes a complementary theoretical lens to diffusion theory, enabling the explanation of the process to create shared meaning when idea and recipient context have a low level of compatibility. Second, this research shows the process of translating agile into a traditional context through a non-linear joint creation of meaning. The process was shaped largely by the experience and resolution of project-external (i.e., with the surrounding organization) and project-internal conflicts, which in turn motivated the idea or context to adapt. The study identifies two central concepts, namely isolation, and shielding, which determine how the translation process unfolds and how meaning is created.

Drawing on the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, we conduct a meta-analysis summarizing findings from 145 empirical studies on 434,985 firms with 798,650 firm-year observations. We distinguish between knowledge-rich environments with abundant, easily accessible information; knowledge-protected environments with high levels of intellectual property rights protection; and knowledge-intensive environments with high levels of reliance on knowledge. Our study assesses the impact of the environment on the AC\u2013INN relationship. First, we confirm that knowledge-rich environments create more opportunities to reap innovation benefits from AC compared to knowledge-scarce environments. Driven by the development of communication technologies and increased information sharing, the effects of AC on innovation are almost twice larger in the smartphone era as they were during the preinternet or early internet era. Second, our analysis indicates that high levels of knowledge protection, as seen in North America and Europe, while safeguarding intellectual property, also dampen positive effects of absorptive capacity on innovation. In environments with less knowledge protection, the effects of AC on innovation are stronger. Finally, our findings suggest that AC is beneficial across industry sectors, but its effects are stronger in less knowledge-intensive sectors. The mean effect size in low-tech manufacturing and services is two times larger than in high-tech industries. Beyond contextual effects, we assess AC's effects on two major creativity outputs: invention, as a breakthrough scientific discovery, and commercialization, as a socially usable and marketable product. Our findings show that AC overall boosts innovation and is more strongly associated with commercialization than with invention.

Prior research has primarily focused on firm-level factors, paying little attention to individual-level antecedents of GNPIs. This imbalance in the GNPI literature contrasts with the broader innovation and general management literature, which displays an ever-growing interest in the \u201chuman side of innovation,\u201d acknowledging the relevance of Chief Executive Officers' (CEOs') political ideologies for organizational outcomes. Addressing this imbalance, our study examines the relationship between CEOs' political ideologies and their firms' GNPIs, along with the conditions that shape this influence. Grounded in social identity theory, our study first argues that the more liberal CEOs are, the more GNPIs their firms are likely to generate and that this association is amplified by CEO power. It then proposes that the more liberal CEOs are, the more likely they are to respond to adverse situations beyond their control (a Republican presidency or lower levels of consumer green sentiment) by initiating more GNPIs. It finally posits that the more liberal CEOs are, the fewer GNPIs they tend to initiate in response to adverse situations for which they are accountable (involvement in sustainability-related scandals).

The literature recommends that partners adopt collaborative, empathetic mindsets but even so, tensions can threaten outcomes and partnership continuation. Difficulties can be exacerbated when firms engage stakeholder organizations in sustainability-oriented innovation projects, where each partner is seeking their own combination of social, environmental, and economic objectives. This study explores strategic responses to these differences in logics through eight case studies of sustainability-oriented innovation engagements between a focal business and an external organization. The key finding is that partners can respond to their differing logics by shaping a new \u201cengagement logic\u201d that guides members of both (or all) organizations. A logic frame with four value-related dimensions\u2014value salience, instrumentality, temporality, and language\u2014allows a subtly idiosyncratic engagement logic to be created that is acceptable to both parties. This classification of ingredients of a logic frame forms a wider contribution to the institutional-logics literature. A complementary range of logic practices is identified, covering logic emergence, logic enactment, and boundary defining. The engagement logic aids the partnership by contributing to four partnership-level generative outcomes: partnership commitment, capability integration, scope flexibility, and system orientation. A notable finding is the presence of a logic boundary, specified in work, time, and space, enabling the engagement logic to co-exist with organizational logics; a research direction is whether this boundary also exists in logics at organizational and field levels.

Specifically, cultural distance from the platform's host country can impede the mobilizing of home-country stakeholders. Conversely, while attracting host-country stakeholders may appear advantageous, these benefits are uncertain and limited for culturally-proximal entrepreneurs.

Holding this option allows VCs to benefit from the ventures' upside potential. Since exit amounts to giving up the option, the option value represents an opportunity cost of exit.

However, the ESG disclosure requirements in 19 other countries, which are not climate-risk-specific, do not alter the effect of climate risk on bank loan pricing.", "authors": "Wenxia Ge, Zhen Qi, Zhenyu Wu, Li Yu", "published": "03 October 2024"}, {"title": "HRM Algorithms: Moderating the Relationship between Chaotic Markets and Strategic Renewal", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12852", "abstract": "HRM algorithms can profoundly impact organizations in the digital economy era. In the face of turbulent and complex market conditions, strategic renewal is regarded as one of the most important organizational mechanisms for dealing with market uncertainty and a turbulent environment. However, the existing research remains elusive about the relationship between market-level conditions and firm-level strategic renewal. Our paper addresses this important gap by examining the potential enhancement of agile strategic renewal in high-uncertainty environments through the implementation of HRM algorithms. Drawing on Chaos Theory, we argue that HRM algorithms have the potential to support the self-organization capacity of a workforce, supporting better alignment with changing environments. Using covariance-based structural equation modelling on a survey of over 500 Spanish firms, our findings provide partial support for the modelled hypotheses by showing that the use of HRM algorithms positively moderates the relationship between market turbulence and strategic renewal, but does not appear to moderate the relationship between market complexity and strategic renewal. The study contributes to our understanding of the importance of adopting internal business analytics systems to stimulate agility and align the workforce more effectively with changing environments, but also highlights their less substantive role in deciphering complex external factors.", "authors": "Yancy Vaillant, Ferran Vendrell-Herrero, Oscar F.

One perspective proposes that the organizational embeddedness of ground-level governance actors, ordained by high-level governance actors (such as the board of directors), obstructs their discretion. In contrast, the other perspective, building on institutional complexity, propounds that multiple institutional demands facilitate the situated agency and discretion of ground-level governance actors. Consistent with the emerging multilevel research on institutional complexity, we combine these two perspectives by including both the structural and static meso-level factors (i.e. organizational embeddedness) as well as actors' situated agency. Utilizing three comparative cases, we demonstrate that internal auditors' ability to exercise discretion is facilitated (obstructed) when organizational embeddedness enables (constrains) the cohabitation of multiple institutional logics at the organizational level.

Various reasons for short-termism have been identified, including undervaluing long-term earnings, increased financial obstacles associated with longer investment horizons, and the adoption of financial control systems to meet investors\u2019 demands for quarterly earnings reports. As a result, firms may opt for suboptimal short-term investment projects while neglecting potentially valuable long-term initiatives. Most research has focused on large corporates, which constitute a small fraction of the economy and involve multiple stakeholders. There is a significant knowledge gap regarding small owner-managed firms that rely primarily on internal financing and bank debt for investment. Our study fills this gap by analysing a comprehensive UK finance and investment decision-making survey of 1501 firms across all classes. The survey reveals that investment appraisal relies on a \u2018payback\u2019 period. We find that 58.8% of firms choose a payback period of 3 years or less, with shorter payback periods more prominent among the smallest firms. This suggests that financial frictions impact the investment behaviour of the smallest firms, while shareholder-driven short-termism influences the largest firms but only in relation to research and development projects.", "authors": "Marc Cowling, Nicholas Wilson", "published": "16 May 2024"}]}, {"uri": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970266", "data": [{"title": "The competitive dynamics of strategic risk-taking, unethical behavior, and entry", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3650", "abstract": "Research Summary\n            \n            This article argues that strategic risk-taking in the form of unethical behavior can lead to successful entry and that this entry can drive incumbents to either adopt similar behavior or potentially be forced out of the market.

Since the locus of identification, evaluation, and selection of external solutions remains internal to the firm's R&D personnel, we argue that they frequently prefer familiar over novel solutions. We identify two factors that help firms overcome this preference for familiarity: when top managers focus their attention on the market problem or when they receive feedback from unexpected failures to solve that problem.

We found that these intra-professional groupings sought to make sense of AI through a triadic view focused on the interplay of professional, client and technology. This sensemaking, arising from different jurisdictional contexts, led individual professionals to perceive that their agency was diminished, complemented or enhanced as a result of the introduction of AI.

In this work, the politico-ethical tensions are evident between the requirements of practicing an occupation and those of the communities, who in turn exhibit hierarchies, conflicts, and diversity within and between themselves. I suggest that taking a community-centric approach to memory work can serve the dynamic integrity of memories, and foster community engagement and empowerment. Memory workers, then, can account for the politico-ethical struggles over memories by orchestrating interpretive, open, and embodied mnemonic practices to remain in tune with the diverse, disputed, polyvocal, and ever-unfolding memories.

This credential provides psychological permission for groups to relax their moral strivings, such that they are less likely to question the influence of bias in group member selection decisions, and thus more likely to make subsequent homogenous group member additions.

Our results: (1) contribute to PCSR and \u2018government and CSR\u2019 studies by conceptualizing a systemic and dynamic view of cross-level orchestration of governmental CSR strategies; (2) advance transnational governance studies by consolidating orchestration theories and considering coercive power, and (3) add to power transition theory by explaining how regulatory capacity-building enables shifts of cross-level orchestration configurations.", "authors": "Hyemi Shin, Jean-Pascal Gond", "published": "08 May 2024"}, {"title": "How Professionals Adapt to Artificial Intelligence: The Role of Intertwined Boundary Work", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joms.12936", "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has generated extensive debates about the future of work in the professions.

Drawing on expectation states theory, we identify contexts in which each type of CEO succession with gender change can have positive effects on strategic change and subsequent firm performance, depending on whether the degree of gender parity in the context is sufficient for the new CEO to enact strategic changes. Consistent with our arguments, we report findings from Chinese and US samples showing that in the presence of high environmental dynamism female-to-male CEO succession yields greater strategic change. Conversely, when environmental dynamism is low, it is male-to-female CEO succession that brings about greater strategic change. Furthermore, in the Chinese context, we found that female-to-male CEO succession in state-owned companies results in greater strategic change, whereas male-to-female CEO succession has the same effect in privately-owned settings.

I make three contributions. First, I complement the issue-selling literature by theorizing voice work as the purposeful efforts made by middle and lower managers to pass challenges from the bottom to the top during change. These efforts are grouped into three sets of moves: relational, reflexive and skip level. Second, I contribute to the voice literature by explaining when MMs decide to speak up through relational moves (balancing and integrating) and how they shape their voice message through reflexive moves (preparing and refining). Lastly, I refine our understanding of skip level voice by defining skip level moves (overriding and reinforcing), introducing nuance into how lower managers\u2019 voice can strengthen or destabilize MMs. Voice work ultimately enriches our processual understanding of voice as a dynamic phenomenon worked on by multiple layers of management.

This is especially the case in family firms, where the CEO is often a family member and familial ties regularly take priority over ties with individuals from outside the family (i.e., non-family members). In this article, we focus on the role of trust as a potential enabler of TMT voice in family firms. Primary matched triadic data from CEOs (n\u2009=\u200979) and family and non-family TMT members (n\u2009=\u2009158) in 79 family firms demonstrate that trust perceptions (feeling trusted by the CEO and perceptions of CEO trustworthiness) have a positive effect on TMT voice behaviour and perceived job performance. Interestingly, this positive effect is significant only for non-family members, suggesting trust perceptions are more imperative for non-family TMT members when it comes to speaking up to the boss.

We find that while AI and board network heterogeneity both favourably affect risk, operating in a high-AI industry while occupying a network position that spans industry boundaries mitigates these effects, leading to an increase in IR for firms in the most technologically advanced industries.

Recent research has found that a firm can facilitate the discovery and subsequent purchase of its product by giving it an advantageous name.

We theorize that a product may benefit from the names of competitors\u2019 products within its niche because certain product names can trigger a positive spillover effect. Specifically, product viability should increase with the proliferation of products with informative names in a focal niche because informative names attract attention to the niche, and consequently benefit all its products, regardless of whether they have informative names or not. This beneficial influence should be especially strong when a niche is new. Additionally, a product's market fate may depend not only on the prevalent naming practices in its niche, but also on naming practices in competing niches. We find support for our theorizing in event-history analyses of all CD-drive products shipped in the worldwide optical disk drive industry, 1983\u20131999.

Specifically, we theorize that mortality cues can increase leader death anxiety, giving rise to leader expediency (a leader's use of unethical practices to expedite work for self-serving purposes); however, mortality cues can also facilitate leader death reflection and, consequently, servant leadership behaviour. We further suggest that leaders\u2019 responses to mortality cues depend on their psychological capital (PsyCap), such that leaders with high (vs. low) PsyCap respond to mortality cues with less expediency (via death anxiety) and more servant leader behaviours (via death reflection).

To understand the relationship between career and family within the increasing number of precarious professions, we analyse interviews with 102 journalists.

Together, these practices touch more family members \u2013 spouses, children, parents, siblings, and extended family members \u2013 and involve a wider range of resources than documented in stable fields. By piecing together variations of these practices, professionals construct career strategies that address their difficult context in different ways. Two strategies largely accept the demands and precarity, by prioritizing career and drawing on family, or prioritizing career and forgoing family. A third, prioritizing family over career, involves defying the demands. Gender does not clearly influence which career strategy people pursue.

Drawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory and focusing on Chief Executives Officers (CEOs) who engage in political networking (PN), we investigate how PN affects CEO burnout. We conceptualize PN as a form of relational exchanges between firms and political entities, positing that PN entails substantial resource depletion for those deeply involved, primarily due to significant ethical and moral challenges (i.e., identity threat). As PN intensifies, CEOs are compelled to allocate more time, effort and energy to navigate these escalating challenges, consequently exacerbating CEO burnout. Through the analysis of a 2-year matched survey of CEOs and comprehensive archive data, we find robust support for our hypothesis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CEO altruism and institutional knowledge weaken the relationship between PN and CEO burnout, indicating that individual intentions to benefit the collective and the ability to navigate such networking practices alter CEOs' perceived identity challenges.

I discuss the motivational dynamics involved in labour participation rates, how basic income may impact basic psychological needs and wellbeing, how basic income may impact workplace environments, and whether neoliberal capitalist values are a useful framework through which to discuss basic income. From this perspective, the benefits of basic income to individuals and society are promising.

By integrating implicit leadership theories with the attentional focus model, we examine when followers perceive leader humility favourably and unfavourably due to valuing leader characteristics differently in different situations. We suggest that followers are more likely to value (disvalue) leader humility when there is less (more) time pressure. Specifically, followers are inclined to attribute leader humility as comprehensive (indecisive) when time pressure is low (high), resulting in high (low) evaluations on leader effectiveness and satisfaction with leader. The results of an experiment and a three-wave survey support our predictions, which advances knowledge about the benefits and perils of leader humility and their underlying mechanisms.", "authors": "Shengming Liu, Jih-Yu Mao, Ning Li, Zhang Yue", "published": "20 September 2024"}, {"title": "Multi-Temporality and the Ghostly: How Communing with Times Past Informs Organizational Futures", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joms.13022", "abstract": "Despite growing interest in time, history, and memory, we lack an understanding of the multi-temporal reality of organizations \u2013 how past, present, and future intersect to inform organizational life. In assuming that legacies are bequeathed from past to present, there has been little theorization on how this works practically. We propose that the lexicon of the ghostly can help. We contribute a theory of ghostly influence from past to future by offering a framework focusing on core moments of organizational existence: foundation, strategic change, and longevity commemoration, and illustrate this using a case study of consumer goods multinational Procter & Gamble (1930\u20132010). In showing that organizational ghosts, absent members whose presence is consequential to the actions of living members, are active and dialogical, we illuminate a dialectical interaction missing from other non-linear conceptions of temporality. This emphasizes the performative force of a dynamic past that provides an inference to action in the present and future.", "authors": "Mairi Maclean, Charles Harvey, Roy Suddaby, Diego M.

Further, in a decision experiment, we study alliance managers\u2019 heuristics applied to the decision of whether to pursue an outside partnering opportunity during the course of an alliance re-evaluation. Our results show that in their decision heuristics alliance managers rate value creation-related partner characteristics more highly than commitment-related partner characteristics. However, the importance of commitment-related characteristics is contingent on the level and dimension of uncertainty present in the managers\u2019 environment. Thus, our findings call for a more nuanced perspective on environmental uncertainty in alliance re-evaluation decision making.

Based on a two-year qualitative case study of a major strategic change in a research unit at a university that encouraged academics to embody an upbeat, energetic work rhythm, we identify four different modes of engaging with rhythms (syncing, tuning, figuring, and settling). We found that individual academics engaged rhythmically in different ways to meet this expected way of working and with discernible consequences for how they participated in the strategic change and ultimately were able to support the change, or not. Based on our study findings, we conceptualize a process model of rhythmic coping that highlights a central but often overlooked part of strategic change with significant implications for the success of a change as well as for the continued health and well-being of employees.", "authors": "Kathleen A.

Whereas investors largely rely on quantitative information in evaluating this important aspect of non-financial performance, scarce research has explored how firms may exploit the numerical magnitudes of carbon targets. We examine this possibility by analysing deceptive parameter changes in carbon targets after initial adoption, wherein firms create the perception of strengthening carbon targets while in reality loosening them, a novel form of decoupling. We theorize a U-shaped relationship between the most conspicuous target parameter, target size (percentage emissions reduction), and the propensity for deceptive target change based on countervailing pressures \u2013 stakeholder expectation management and target attainment \u2013 that create tension. We further propose greater investor pressure over policy, through long-term ownership and shareholder voice, exacerbates these pressures whereas media controversy that may prompt investor scrutiny over practice deters deceptive target changes.

However, these distinct types of referents from different sources are conceptually unique and operate differently, which could give rise to dissimilar behaviours. Because corporate performance information can emanate internally from agency-driven firms and externally from financial analysts, we examine both in a unified framework. To facilitate a deeper understanding of these relationships, we investigate how alternate income streams from business unit (BU) performance at a lower level in the organizational structure moderate the way corporate managers remedy corporate performance shortfalls at a higher level. Our study contributes to the behavioural theory by examining distinct influences of corporate performance goals derived from internally- versus externally imposed referents and their interactions with BU performance on new market entry activities.

We highlight how the assumptions of agency theory continue to dominate the design and implementation of management practices and management education, despite decades of evidence that individuals are not solely driven by economic rationality. We suggest that attempts to refine these assumptions have so far fallen short of adequately representing human motivation and highlight an important aspect of self-determination theory which is often neglected from these debates: how people come to internalize goals.

Pursuing a calling is a double-edged sword, sometimes beneficial and sometimes detrimental, but it is unclear why it has contradictory effects. We show how daily self-sacrifice behaviour explains these effects and reveals how workers regulate their callings on a daily basis. We argue that people with intense callings use self-sacrifice to attain daily calling goals. However, this has a cost to their wellbeing in terms of daily emotional exhaustion. Diary data from church ministers and chaplains reveals that daily self-sacrifice behaviour mediates the positive effects of calling intensity, via felt obligations, on both daily calling goal attainment and emotional exhaustion. Within-person, we show how state self-esteem further regulates this double-edged process both within a day and from one day to the next. Low morning state self-esteem promotes daily self-sacrifice and is indirectly related to higher calling goal attainment and emotional exhaustion via daily self-sacrifice. But morning self-esteem is itself predicted positively by the previous days\u2019 goal attainment and negatively by emotional exhaustion. Therefore, state self-esteem in conjunction with daily self-sacrifice behaviour and its double-edged effects represents a daily regulation mechanism for self-sacrifice in callings.", "authors": "Michael E.

With the Islamic religious logic being novel to the German field of banking and finance, innovative templates were established to deal effectively with the resulting tensions and conflicts. Drawing on qualitative data, we investigate how the bank, with its strong commitment to Islam, navigated such novel institutional complexity and the challenges stemming from the jurisdictional overlap. We identify four distinct compromise mechanisms in this institutionally complex situation, in which a committed actor prioritizes one logic over another: explaining, convincing, conceding and suspending. Importantly, as options, these mechanisms are situated in a cascading order of preference for the focal actor. More generally, our research posits that in any encounter between institutional logics in which the specific instantiation of a logic stems from a foreign interinstitutional system, the resulting novel institutional complexity may necessitate the development of innovative templates which, at the same time, may imply \u2018stretching\u2019 an institutional logic and, in consequence, impact the compatibility of its jurisdictional claims.", "authors": "Ali Aslan G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fay, Renate E.

My conclusion is a large-scale adoption of SDT \u2013 to the exclusion or minimization of other views \u2013 would not be advisable. I base this conclusion on the logic that needs vary in importance across individuals and needs are broader than those encompassed by SDT.

Self-authorship is a mode of autonomy given expression through the effective exercise of economic liberties. Mutual benefit involves the intentional pursuit of the well-being of one\u2019s transaction partners within economic exchange. These values are uniquely realized, I argue, within business, conceptualized as a distinct, firm-level, social practice. More specifically, individuals realize self-authorship by purposively integrating cospecialized resources, forms of knowledge, and business functions to facilitate mutually beneficial transactions. Through their commitment to mutual benefit, businesspersons establish ongoing, cooperative relationships with customers, members of other firms, and various stakeholders more generally. These relationships are constitutive of a distinct liberal notion of the common good. The practice of business and the common good in a market society are sustained by a range of individual-level virtues.

Instead, we found some consistent succession dynamics. Within this consistency, we found variations in decision-making models among subsidiaries\u2014some adopting a rule-based approach with a short succession dynamic, some adopting a goal-based approach with a moderate succession dynamic, and others adopting a people-based approach with a long succession dynamic.

The central message is that looking solely at GM succession dynamics through an organizational learning lens may risk overlooking relevant causal mechanisms.

We examine the effects of two policies on Chinese firms\u2019 technology acquisitions: China\u2019s Made in China 2025 (MIC2025), initiated in 2015, and the U.S. response in 2018 through the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA). We argue that MIC2025 encouraged Chinese companies to acquire U.S. technology companies, and that this was perceived as a threat in the U.S., which countered through FIRRMA to limit such acquisitions. Using acquisition data from 2010 to 2022, we find that MIC2025 increased Chinese firms\u2019 acquisition announcements in critical technology sectors in the U.S., but FIRRMA had a negative effect on both announcements and completions. We also find evidence suggesting spillover effects of FIRRMA to countries that are U.S. allies, but only if they are innovation leaders with low trade dependence on China.

When faced with symbolic threats related to ethics and morals in a host country, MNEs act rigidly and conservatively, increasing the likelihood of deploying parent-country nationals as executives in foreign subsidiaries. When dealing with realistic threats associated with potential economic losses in a host country, however, MNEs are adaptive, decreasing the tendency to transfer parent-country nationals abroad and increasing the use of host-country nationals in foreign subsidiaries. The two threats interact in affecting staffing decisions. Moreover, industry globalization moderates asymmetrically the influences of the two threats: globalization strengthens the effect of symbolic threats but weakens the effect of realistic threats.

Attention and moral convergence foster the cross-country spread of reputation loss following the scandal, potentially penalizing MNEs associated with The Weinstein Company and adversely affecting their international revenue. Conversely, differences in traditional and digital media coverage and misaligned formal and informal institutions hinder the spread of reputation loss.

In a reanalysis of Bligh et al. (2004), we find that the rhetoric of President George W. Bush changed after 9/11 to include more references to charismatic themes. We replicate these results using President Francois Hollande reactions to terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016 (i.e., Charlie Hebdo, Paris, and Nice attacks). Across both studies, we find similar evidence for an upward shift in charismatic rhetoric and approval ratings at the time of crisis. Our findings contribute to the literature on charisma and crisis by showing that the emergence of charisma is not only a follower attributional process but that veritable behavior of leaders can change.

Employing a framing perspective and utilizing longitudinal data from a single case, this study presents a process model of strategic leaders' framing-induced idea erosion. At the heart of this process are two dynamics. First is a dynamic consisting of the anticipation of innovation that fails to account for the necessary iterative process, leading to a growing mismatch between expectations and activities. Second is a dynamic consisting of cognitive processes, where strategic leaders frame this mismatch as a failure, this intensifying over time.

However, the validity of this identification method is not yet fully established. Not all innovations can be protected through intellectual property rights and some firms may deliberately choose not to pursue formal protection. This study uses patent, trademark and survey data from two distinct samples of SMEs and mid-cap firms from Germany and Italy to investigate whether green patents and green trademarks can effectively identify green innovative firms. The findings reveal that relying solely on patent- and trademark-based measures of green innovation leads to the exclusion of many green innovative firms.

The absence of or weak governance of failure might lead to a fundamental misjudgement: Treating a failure (i.e. an unsatisfactory result in uncertain situations in which actors do not know ex-ante the best way to define goals, plans, and outcomes) as an error (i.e. a deviation from expected and desired results in known situations). The governance of failure is more critical for firms shifting from incremental towards radical innovation. In this situation, strategic leaders play a decisive role in performing radical innovation projects and crafting the pathway for transforming the governance to address failure underlying radical innovation processes. However, the current scholarship offers limited guidance on how strategic leaders and organisations transform their governance to cope with failure (i.e. rules and mechanisms) in radical innovation endeavours. Based on a rich qualitative study of eight case studies involving 63 interviews in Brazil, we clarify the role of strategic leaders in transforming the governance of failure in innovation activities. The primary contribution of this study is a new multi-stage, multi-faceted theoretical framework for governance transformation to address failures related to radical innovation processes: Reducing, emancipatory moving, understanding, and incorporating. This new framework contains two significant novelties: A new type of governance, known as the governance of failure, and a unique set of activities and tasks to change the governance structure from error prevention to coping with failures concerning implementing radical innovation processes.", "authors": "Leonardo Augusto de Vasconcelos Gomes, Ximena Alejandra Flechas Chaparro, Rafaela Ferreira Mani\u00e7oba, Felipe Mendes Borini, Lucas Emmanuel Silva", "published": null}, {"title": "Institutional quality and success in U.S. equity crowdfunding", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873332400163X", "abstract": "In equity crowdfunding, establishing legitimacy is crucial for firms to mitigate the information asymmetry investors face.

Our analysis of 505 top corporate R&D investors from the U.S. manufacturing industry confirms a significant relationship between technological radicalness and servitization, but it is nuanced and depends on the level of financial resources available to firms, known as financial resource slack. More specifically, firms with higher slack have a greater extent of servitization activities when their technologies are more radical.

We find that while expertise fosters the recognition and selection of novel ideas, being in a decision-maker role hinders it. Moreover, the effects of expertise on idea selection decrease for those in a decision-maker role. To extend the generalizability of our findings, we conducted Study 2\u2014a field study employing data collected from an international firm's ideation platform over the course of 11\u00a0months. We find support for the contrasting effects of expertise and decision-maker role on the selection of novel ideas. Our findings suggest how idea evaluation processes in, for instance, open innovation or crowdsourcing contexts can be organized more effectively.", "authors": "Michela Beretta, Dirk Deichmann, Lars Frederiksen, Daan Stam", "published": null}, {"title": "A portfolio approach to research funding", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733324001781", "abstract": "This study argues that portfolio theory can provide a powerful tool to make research funding decisions. The proposed methodology allows for an informed management decision process, also in the presence of project interdependencies and multiple policy objectives.

The most common approach is merit-based funding where the evaluators' scores of the individual proposals guide funding decisions. A possible explanation is that conventions play a role in the selection process.

We find that, in the long run, the influence of network linkages is as important as that of neighbor innovativeness. In the short run, however, positive shocks to neighbor innovativeness yield relatively rapid effects, while the impact of shocks strengthening network linkages manifests with delay, even though lasts longer.

Listening to stakeholders may also deplete entrepreneurs' personal resources, diminishing their listening capacity. This paradox can be overcome by generating their ventures' listening capability\u2014behavioral routines and attention structures for listening\u2014enabling them to acquire and interpret quality information from stakeholders more effectively to build or adapt the capabilities necessary for venture growth.

Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 30 dedicated CVC investment arms, we analyze how successful units configure their internal arrangements in response to these tensions and generate various innovation outcomes for their parent organizations. We identify four different solutions for effective CVC unit configurations, highlighting that explorative and exploitative innovation success require different setups. Moreover, we find that more mature and explorative CVC units distance themselves via buffering from their corporate sponsor, while at the same time increasing their efforts to maintain deliberate connections via bridging to representatives of the very same corporate environment they stem from. For ambidextrous CVC units, a more dynamic setup that allows corporate leadership to selectively initiate collaboration with the corporate core when beneficial while facilitating distancing at other times proved successful. Our study contributes new evidence and theory on how CVC units can navigate tensions and balance competing demands at the interface of the corporate and venturing domains.", "authors": "Magnus Sch\u00fcckes, Benedikt Unger, Tobias Gutmann, Gerwin Fels", "published": null}, {"title": "Echoes of the past: The long-lasting effects of entrepreneurs' generational imprints on value-creation models", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902624000740", "abstract": "We draw from theories of generations and imprinting to introduce an alternative conceptualization of the effects of age on entrepreneurship\u2014namely, entrepreneurs' generational imprints.

In two studies in the Mexican context, we find that entrepreneurs from a conservative generation create more financial value than social value, while entrepreneurs from a progressive generation create more social value than financial value. We also explore the intervening mechanisms and find that entrepreneurs who are more embedded in the church and their families and have more family obligations are more likely to experience generational imprinting. We further show that women tend to experience generational imprinting differently than men, leading to important heterogeneity in our results. Finally, we find that older entrepreneurs experience generational imprints more acutely than their counterparts.

We argue that when a VC firm has a short investment horizon, it may guide its portfolio companies to develop new products fast to increase the likelihood of successful exits. However, this deliberate effort may act as a double-edged sword for ventures. That is, VC firms' guidance on product commercialization could inadvertently expose ventures to product quality problems. Building on this notion, we suggest that ventures backed by VC firms with short investment horizons may experience more product quality problems than those backed by VC firms with long investment horizons. We further suggest that the effect of a VC firm's investment horizon on product quality problems is mitigated when the venture is invested by corporate VC investors but amplified when the venture develops complex products.
